yellow points in the upper right part of the point
cloud. Theoretically the points should vary smoothly from purple to
yellow. We find this with the new sample in Fig. (2) where we have
reduced the region of $k_{-1}$ that we sample from $\log(k_{-1}) \in
[-4, 0]$ to $\log(k_{-1}) \in [-4, -1]$ so as to obey the inequality
introduced above. Now the direction of changing $k_{eff}$ matches the
direction of changing model response.

    values of $k_{eff}$ do not necessarily correspond to changing
    model response. \textbf{Here we color by $k_{eff}$}}

  \caption{New sample in which $k_{eff}$ and $\delta(\theta)$ change
    in the same directions. \textbf{Here we color by
      $\log(\delta(\theta))$}. The two red planes represent the
    minimum and maximum values of $k_{eff}$ present in the dataset,
    and they closely match the boundaries of the point cloud as expected.}
