\title{Attempting to find important parameters in sloppy models}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

We use Antonios' model in which $a$ and $\lambda$ are important parameters while $b$ and $\epsilon$ are sloppy. Holding $b$ fixed, we are left with a three-parameter model with two important parameters and one sloppy. We subsequently attempt to recover a parameterization of $a$ and $\lambda$ using the modified DMAPS kernel. This does not seem to have been met with more success than could be expected of the traditional DMAPS kernel.

The final direction corresponding to $\lambda$, also the most highly constrained axis, was not found in the first 30 eigenvectors.
